            <h2>Assignment 10</h2>
            <p>For assignment 10, to me, it seems like CSS is a lot more similar to C++ in structuring than HTML compared to C++. I also did not know just how customization is in CSS, it seems extremely flexible and you can make a lot of unique things with this working with HTML. I think CSS is very important for me and just in general because if I ever do want to focus on web development, CSS is very important for HTML web building because it helps clean up the HTML code by separating it into another file that links the HTML with the CSS styling. I've also used CSS styling before on some programs where people share their own CSS code that you can put into your 'Quick CSS' file that auto updates the look of the program I use, so learning more about CSS styling may inspire me to try making my styling for the program myself.</p>

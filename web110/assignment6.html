For assignment 6 activites, I did research on remote desktop, specifically on Chrome Remote Desktop because I remember using it a couple times back in highschool and it being used by my teacher in my Engineering classes of freshman year to cover the computer screens when he needs to give a lesson. It uses a propietary protocol so it's Google's own created protcol used for this software called Chromoting rather than other protocols made by other companies. Chrome Remote Desktop was originally a Chrome extension, however that is now deprecated and they have a website instead for remote desktop purposes. I guess what I learned from this reading is that remote desktop softwares can do a lot more things that I never really thought about doing and it sounds like it can sometimes be a bit dangerous, but potentially useful for businesses and companies.

Another activity I did research on was FTP, I think I've used something that uses FTP for a videogame, but that was a couple years ago so I can't really remember that. Other than that, FTP is a very useful tool for many people as it can communicate and transfer files between multiple computers with a network and anyone with access to this network can look in the server and is able to send and receive files from the server. What I envision of being able to apply this in my future career is that I'm most likely going to be using it a lot since I want to focus on Computer Science and delve a bit into some of the topics that are discussed in this class, so I have a feeling I will be using a software that uses FTP for sending and receiving a lot of files for a job.

        <p>Something I learned from assignment 9 about HTML is that how simple it is to use it, I would say it's a lot more easy than when I work with C++ (even though these languages are for completely different purposes) to understand and write up, the structing of the code is mostly the same I would say, along with some of the terms we have to learn from the reading, such as WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language because it is a markup language, similar to other languages like C++ where that is a object oriented language.</p>
        
        <p>I think learning HTML and the other languages we will learn in this class is going to be a very important skill to have later in my career because I want to focus on learning as many different languages as possible, be it object oriented or markup language so I have a variety of skills will able to figure out which type of language I like to work with the most.</p>

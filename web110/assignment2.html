For the assignment 2 activities, I've actually swapped between all of the Windows browsers mentioned in the wikiversity page. The one I'm currently using is modified version of Chromium called Ungoogled Chromium which is basically what the name of the browser is; a version of the Chromium browser (also open-source on github) without any of the google web services. My friend recommended this to me a couple days ago after I showed him this website: https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/ and we found out that it apparently does not have any spyware according to that site. I've switched to it recently and so far it basically just feels like a normal version of Google Chrome. In any case, some features I wish this browser had compared to the ones on the wikiversity site is the "Easy Files" feature from the Opera browser.

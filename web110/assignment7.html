        <p>For assignment 7, a new term I learned from this assignment and the Wikiversity reading was the term 'Extranet'. I've heard of Intranet before but I never really thought of the opposite of Intranet, which is what Extranet is. An intranet is a private network inside of an enterprise that only allows company users, so the opposite of that would be a private network that gives access to people who are not just company workers, which is what Extranet is.</p>

        <p>Another term I learned more about from the session was more about DNS or Domain Name System. I knew a bit about DNS and that it was used for domain names like google.com or github.com, but I never knew that it was mainly done by converting IP addresses into domains and that this system is used to make it a lot simpler to access websites without having to type in the full IP address of a site, and just simply using a domain name as the IP address and domain name will be connected and the device connecting to the site will retrieve the IP address from the domain name to just connect to the site via the domain name and not by the IP address.</p>
        
        <p>One more new thing I learned from the session was a switch. I never really heard of what a switch does for networks and the internet but can also be called a bridge. From the Wikiversity reading, I learned that the switch/bridge is a device that is supposed to connect to many network segments/devices and will filter out those segments/devices to send data to devices that are supposed to receive that data. They are also different from network hubs, where a hub connects multiple computers to a single network while a switch is similar except for just connecting computers to a single network, the switch connects multiple devices to a single computer network.</p>

For assignment 4 activities, the first thing I thought was interesting and learned about was email spoofing. I've heard of spoofing before with phone numbers but not too much about it, so it's nice to learn that there is not only spoofing with phone numbers but also with emails. From the reading, I can tell that there are some confirmations that email services have that let you trace the source of an email by looking at it's full headers. So I guess I learned that if you really want to confirm an email you get is legit or not if it wasn't marked as spam, I just have to trace the email with the full headers and find the source of the email. I never really thought that much about the "Show original" feature in Gmail, but now that I have this knowledge it seems very useful.

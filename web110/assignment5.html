        <p>For assignment 5 activities, I took a look at the TutorialsPoint link for social media and noticed that there are some social media that I never really knew about, such as Faceparty and Ibibo. Turns out, one of the social media in that list from the link switched from a social networking service to an e-commerce and travel organization. Hike was also on that list which I never really recall ever hearing about, shut down in 2021, and with Faceparty, after checking the website, it's hard to tell if this website still has a lot of active users on it. I guess what I can say that I learned from taking a look at the social media I'm unaware of is that there are many social networks out there in the world some regions of the world don't know and we are unsure how many have lasted up to this point, so I can say that it's very competitive in this social media market of what networks can stay at the top and if the ones behind the popular services can keep up, otherwise, they are forced to either fall into obscurity, change their services or shut down.</p>

        <p>The other activity I looked at was reviewing the Honeycomb model from Smart Insights that we had to compare multiple social networking services if they support the Honeycomb framework and if any services are lacking in any parts of the Honeycomb. Some services I think that follow the framework elements the most are Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter. I think the only issue I can see with some of the services is reputation, if this is referring to how outsiders see the service, with Twitter and Instagram (in my opinion) having a mixed reputation with how it's always seen where people will always argue with each other, especially with the recent actions Elon Musk has been taking with Twitter, rebranding the name, removing staff, adding subscriptions, etc.</p>
        
        <p>The last thing I learned isn't an activity but a term that I didn't know about called Web 2.0. I thought I knew what I assumed it meant but I guess I was wrong since it's just referring to websites that primarily focus on user-generated content and participation, which is mostly just all of social media as it lets users interact with other users' generated content. What I learned from reading about Web 2.0 is that 2.0 most likely means the current evolved state of the internet, with Web 1.0 having very little of the content that Web 2.0 has, and once 2.0 started, most people started making their profiles on social networking websites.</p>

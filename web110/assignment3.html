For Assignment 3 activites, comparing search engines (being unbiased since I use Google all the time), I think Google has the best interface when compared to the other engines. The Ask engine has very little content with tools, for example, buttons for images, videos, shopping, etc. I would say Bing is the second closest to being as good as Google (and Yahoo behind Bing). Images being included when searching up a piece of media with a description also only shows up for Google, Bing, and Yahoo, with Google & Bing having the best content to display for the results. However, when comparing search results, Google and Bing rival each other in my opinion, and Yahoo and Ask cannot match against Bing and Google.

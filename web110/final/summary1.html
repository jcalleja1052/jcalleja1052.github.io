        <p>When building a website, nowadays the main coding language nowadays to use is HTML, specifically HTML5. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and this is the current standard in the web development market for coding language to create a website with. Back then, PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) was the main language to use in order to create websites. Overtime, the market and the field has drastically changed, with the addition of HTML5 being used in conjunction with JavaScript and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). </p>

        <p>With this, web browsers will take HTML documents and turn them into rendered pages that can be viewed. Without the HTML markup, a webpage will be a white background with black text. HTML is a very incredible tool for all web developers with how flexible it can be used since it can be used together with CSS and JavaScript, but this summary is mostly focusing on HTML.</p>

        <p>HTML offers a lot of different tags for displaying text in a way for each .html page document. The most common tags needed for the site to function normally include the following: the &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt; tag. &lt;html&gt is used to set up the entire code of the HTML document, with &lt;head&gt and &lt;body&gt being inside that tag used for describing the metadata of the HTML document and displaying the content in the document respectively. Some other tags used to displaying text for users to read include &lt;p&gt for paragraphs, &lt;hX&gt being the header tag with X being what number of header you want it to be because, &lt;a&gt for hyperlinks, and &lt;div&gt for creating a divider.</p>

        <div class = "h-example">
            <p>For example:</p>
            <h1 style = "color: #E44D26;">This is header 'h1',</h1>
            <h2 style = "color: #E44D26;">2nd header 'h2',</h2>
            <h3 style = "color: #E44D26;">and header 'h3'.</h3>
        </div>

        <p>However, even with how many tools HTML has to offer, it can lack a bit with the style of the site since it's mostly stuck with a white background and black text and images for content, which is why HTML can be paired with CSS and JavaScript for .html documents to look more stylistic and have more options to customize the content of the .html document.</p>

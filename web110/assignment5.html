For assignment 5 activities, I took a look at the TutorialsPoint link for social media and noticed that there are some social media that I never really knew about, such as Faceparty and Ibibo. Turns out, one of the social media in that list from the link actually switched from a social networking service to an e-commerce and travel organization. Hike was also on that list which I never really recall ever hearing about, shut down in 2021, and with Faceparty, after checking the website, it's hard to tell if this website still has a lot of active users on it.

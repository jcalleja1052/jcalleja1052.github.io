Although I knew that I would know most of the stuff being discussed in the reading for this assignment, there are still some things brought up in the reading that I never really knew. One of the new things I learned about in the reading was the mention of the multiple terms in a URL. I mostly knew the basics of what is part of a URL beforehand (domain name, file path) and how they normally work, but I didn't think of what each part of a URL was called other than the ones I knew. I never knew that the section with "http://" or "https://" was called a scheme, or that with a YouTube video link, the mess of numbers and letters (although it doesn't always have to be like that it can be something simple) is a section of a URL called parameters. One of the other things I learned from the Wikiversity reading is the core protocols IPV4 and IPV6, I knew what they were but I wasn't entirely sure what IPV6 was compared to IPV4, so after reading I now know what IPV6 is, which is simply just a more modern and updated version of the IPV4 protocol that uses 128 bits rather than 32 from IPV4, which means it is more capable of handling internet traffic. The last thing I learned from the reading was what Git was. I've used it many times from many YouTube tutorials that require the software (like the Git Bash tool) and GitHub itself before for checking out repositories, but I never really knew what it did. After reading, I also know now what Git is, which is non file-based storage system, that stores data in snapshots rather than in files. This lets programmers/developers revert to previous versions if needed with control of all versions of the code/program, letting them see the history of every change/commit to a file.

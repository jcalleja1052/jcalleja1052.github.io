For assignment 4 activities, One thing I thought was interesting and learned about was email spoofing. I've heard of spoofing before with phone numbers but not too much about it, so it's nice to learn that there is not only spoofing with phone numbers but also with emails. From the reading, I can tell that there are some confirmations that email services have that let you trace the source of an email by looking at its full headers. So I guess I learned that if you want to confirm an email you get is legit or not if it wasn't marked as spam, I just have to trace the email with the full headers and find the source of the email. I never really thought that much about the "Show original" feature in Gmail, but now that I have this knowledge it seems very useful.

For the other activities, I didn't know what to write about since I already know so much about them that I can't learn something new from those activities/topics, so I'm going to write about some of the key terms that I learned in the Wikiversity reading.

One of the key terms I learned more about was the email security protocols. I'm pretty sure I've at least heard the term SMTP before, but never really knew what it was other than just a way of sending and receiving emails and keeping the mail secure. After the reading, I now know that there are more protocols than just SMTP that have actual differences that aren't just encryption and security. POP(3) is mainly used for accessing messages, while SMTP is meant to send emails. SMTP also uses MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) in its protocol while POP uses MAA (Message Access Agent).

The last key term I've learned was email message components. I've never really known what BCC was, but I know I've at least used Cc (Carbon copy) only once before back in high school. Apparently, it's pretty simple to understand and similar to Cc itself (they just added a B to it standing for Blind, 'Blind carbon copy') where it just hides the addresses entered in the Bcc field in the header of the email. I think it's good to know when creating an email that you at least know how these function because they are useful for many people even if some people will probably never use Cc or Bcc ever in their life.

For Assignment 3 activites, comparing search engines (being unbiased since I use Google all the time), I think Google has the best interface when compared to the other engines. The Ask engine has very little content with tools, for example, buttons for images, videos, shopping, etc. I would say Bing is the second closest to being as good as Google (and Yahoo behind Bing). Images being included when searching up a piece of media with a description also only shows up for Google, Bing, and Yahoo, with Google & Bing having the best content to display for the results. However, when comparing search results, Google and Bing rival each other in my opinion, and Yahoo and Ask cannot match against Bing and Google.

One other activity I learned about is that Boolean Operators are also present with search engines, which I never really thought about actually being used for search queries. Back when I took Computer Science 1 and 2 here, we learned about these concepts and how to use them in our programs we would code, I never really expected to see these again with search engines specifically because I didn't really think that "AND", "OR" and "NOT" would be effective enough with specific searches, so I never really used most terms (except "AND", that one seems to work) whenever I had to search something up sometimes. I guess something I learned about this reading is that most people when searching something using these engines never realize that when they use specific Boolean operator terms, they are getting very specific results.

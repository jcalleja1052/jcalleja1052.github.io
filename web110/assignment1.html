Assignment 1 - WEB110 Internet Fundamentals

For assignment 1, although I knew that I would know most of the stuff being discussed in the reading for this assignment, there are still some things brought up in the reading that I never really knew. One of the new things I learned about in the reading was the mention of the multiple terms in a URL. I mostly knew the basics of what is part of a URL beforehand (domain name, file path) and usually how they normally work, but I didn't really think of what each part of a URL was called other than the ones I knew. I never knew that the section with "http://" or "https://" was called a scheme, or that with a YouTube video link, the mess of numbers and letters is a section of a URL called parameters.

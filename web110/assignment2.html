For the assignment 2 activities, I've actually swapped between all of the Windows browsers mentioned in the wikiversity page. The one I'm currently using is Brave because compared to the rest of the browsers, Brave tends to care more for user privacy than the other browsers, and it's open-source since it uses Chromium, and I would say that it runs very well along with how it isn't very resource intensive compared to the other browsers. I would say the only things that I'm not a fan of with Brave browser is the lack of the downloads button for whatever you download from the browser, since for me that button only appears when you download something and it's not there at all times. The other thing I wish Brave had was the "Easy Files" function from Opera, which is actually my favorite feature from that browser. That function lets you attach files without having to open your file explorer on Windows, showing the three most recent files. In my opinion, the best part about that feature is that whatever is on your clipboard (like an image) can also show up on the Easy Files feature too.

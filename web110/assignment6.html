For assignment 6 activites, I did research on remote desktop, specifically on Chrome Remote Desktop because I remember using it a couple times back in highschool and it being used by my teacher in my Engineering classes of freshman year to cover the computer screens when he needs to give a lesson. It uses a propietary protocol so it's Google's own created protcol used for this software called Chromoting rather than other protocols made by other companies. Chrome Remote Desktop was originally a Chrome extension, however that is now deprecated and they have a website instead for remote desktop purposes.

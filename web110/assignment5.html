For assignment 5 activities, I took a look at the TutorialsPoint link for social media and noticed that there are some social media that I never really knew about, such as Faceparty and Ibibo. Turns out, one of the social media in that list from the link actually switched from a social networking service to an e-commerce and travel organization. Hike was also on that list which I never really recall ever hearing about, shut down in 2021, and with Faceparty, after checking the website, it's hard to tell if this website still has a lot of active users on it. I guess what I can say what I learned from taking a look at the social media I'm unaware of is that there are many social networks out there in the world some regions of the world don't know and we are unsure how many have lasted up to this point, so I can say that it's very competitive in this social media market of what networks can stay at the top and if the ones behind the popular services are able to keep up, otherwise they are forced to either fall into obscurity, change their services or shut down.

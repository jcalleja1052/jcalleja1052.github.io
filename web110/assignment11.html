        <p>For assignment 11, some new things I learned was about raster files. I always knew about PNGs, JPEG/JPGs and all those other file extension names, but I did not know that those are actually raster files. I also did not really know the big difference between raster files and vector files until the reading and lecture this week, where the difference between raster files and vector files is that vector files are lossless compared to raster files which aren't so they can be resized to width and height they can without losing quality. Raster files cannot do this because they are not lossless, so resizing to a bigger size than normal can result in losing quality.</p>
        
        <p>Another thing I learned was the .TIFF file extension. I have never heard of a Tagged Image File Format before, so I now know that this is a file extension that uses lossless compression despite it being a raster graphics file. The only drawback with this extension is that it is unable to support interlacing/animation.</p>

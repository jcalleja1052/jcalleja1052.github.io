For assignment 7, some new terms I learned from this assignment and the Wikiversity reading was the term 'Extranet'. I've heard of Intranet before but I never really thought of the opposite of Intranet, which is what Extranet basically is. Intranet is a private network inside of an enterprise that only allows company users, so the opposite of that would be a private network that gives access to people who are not just company workers, which is what Extranet is.

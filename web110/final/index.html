<!--
    You may create a WEBSITE that explains or demonstrates master of course concepts. 
    This option gives you the opportunity to PRACTICE what you like about coding!! 
    Use your  bitbucket account to post a final project in your "web110/final" folder. 

    You want to have at least a couple of pages (i.e. home page, and topic pages). Depending on what you want to explore... 
    you may have many pages or 1 or 2 more complex pages. 
    For example, if you want to really explore CSS and how you can make a web design come to life, perhaps fewer pages would be necessary. 

    You can use this site to explain your understanding of a topic like a tutorial or an explanation 
    (i.e. HTML version of the Youtube option) 
    OR you can use this opportunity to simply DEMONSTRATE your newfound understanding of a topic and simply explain how you implemented it 
    (i.e. Show and Tell style)

    Use Images, Fonts, colors, etc. BE CREATIVE. 
    If you come up with a clever spin on the concept, I would be VERY happy about that!!
    Please reach out with questions via email.
